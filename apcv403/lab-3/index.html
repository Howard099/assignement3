        Using a non standard font
    </h1>

    <h2>
        Font name: Permanent Marker 
    </h2>

    <p>
        For this week, I was assigned to look for a non-standard font on the internet and to use it throughout my web page. To accomplish that, I first went to Google Fonts and picked a non-standard font named 'Permanent Marker.' I then downloaded the true-type font file from the site. Then I placed my font near my HTML file in a folder called 'fonts.' From there, I only had to export that font with the @font-face declaration where my source was 'URL (fonts/pm.ttf).' My font has been imported; I can now point to it with our old font-family property.
